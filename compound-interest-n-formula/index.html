<p>Suppose an account with an original balance of 1000 is earning 12 per year and is compounded monthly. Calculates principal principal plus interest rate or time using the standard compound interest formula a p 1 r n nt. Example of compound interest formula. Other than the first year the interest compounded annually is always greater than that in case of simple interest. Compound interest or interest on interest is calculated with the compound interest formula.</p>

<p>It s quite complex because it takes into consideration not only the annual interest rate and the number of years but also the number of times the interest is compounded per year. From the data it is clear that the interest rate for the first year in compound interest is the same as that in case of simple interest ie. The compound interest formula is p 1 i n p where p is the principal i is the annual interest rate and n is the number of periods. In this formula p principal i interest rate n number of compounding periods and t the number of years for which the money is invested or borrowed. Pv fv 1 r n.</p>

<p>Pv fv 1 r n. The formula for compound interest is p 1 r n nt where p is the initial principal balance r is the interest rate n is the number of times interest is compounded per time period and t is the number of time periods. P is the original principal sum p is the new principal sum r is the nominal annual interest rate n is the compounding frequency t is the overall length of time the interest is applied expressed using the same time units as r usually years. The compound interest formula is an equation that lets you estimate how much you will earn with your savings account. Other than the first year the interest compounded annually is always greater than that in case of simple interest.</p>
