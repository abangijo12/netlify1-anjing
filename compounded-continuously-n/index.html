<p>Initial principal amount is 1 000. As can be observed from the above example the interest earned from continuous compounding is 83 28 which is only 0 28 more than monthly compounding. N is the number of times interest is compounded in a year. When n or the number of times compounded is infinite the formula can be rewritten as. The continuous compounding formula can be found by first looking at the compound interest formula. Continuous compounding is the mathematical limit that compound interest can reach.</p>
