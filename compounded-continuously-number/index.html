<p><strong>Compounded Continuously Number</strong>. Rate of interest is 6. In the formula a represents the final amount in the account that starts with an initial principal p using interest rate r for t years. Continuously compounded return is what happens when the interest earned on an investment is calculated and reinvested back into the account for an infinite number of periods. N is the number of times interest is compounded in a year.</p>
