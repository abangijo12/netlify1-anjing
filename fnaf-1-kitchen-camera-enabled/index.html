<p>This is my own theory. This has been proven false. The only way that i know this is because on the fifth night you can see glow white eyes in the kitchen. There s one camera on our little tablet or maybe computer that is disabled. There was also a rumor stating that entering 2 0 1 5 into the custom night settings will unlock an easter egg for five nights at freddy s 2.</p>

<p>This means that the rumor is simply false. On night seven use 6 6 6 6 mode then i play the night then. This has been proven false as no image files exist in the game for the kitchen. There is still no alternate ending to the custom night. We can t even investigate the reason for the little sounds in there.</p>

<p>The camera in the kitchen isn t disabled whoever the lights are off or broken. People believe that there eyes belong to freddy because the fifth nights also the night freddy comes. But if you want some fan made theory well i can t supply that. Very fresh new easter egg in five nights at freddy s. Autoplay when autoplay is enabled.</p>
