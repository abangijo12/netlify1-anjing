<p>I ve seen 1 and 9 before. In all game modes you will have to take them all out to open the doors to the office. The only animatronics that go in the kitchen are freddy and chica. When 1 happened i screamed and had to watch an hour of nyan cat. The cameras are a recurring boss in the first game.</p>

<p>As we can hear from the camera in the kitchen banging clinging of pots and pans again indicating they re moving about. Not just the pictures from the texture files these are the rare easter eggs not include the regular easter eggs that actually found during the gameplay. The bots all looking at the camera cam 1a. Easter egg with golden freddy. And this is fnaf 1 and i also keep seeing page 11 with all the heads looking at cam 5.</p>

<p>The official subreddit for scott cawthon s horror game series five nights at freddy s. And this is fnaf 1 and i also keep seeing page 11 with all the heads looking at cam 5. I do believe that there s a pitch black image for the video of the kitchen in fnaf 1 but i lost links for the game files and i m unable to extract them from the exe if there s an image for that area someone should brighten it and configure the contrast to see if there s anything. Not just the pictures from the texture files these are the rare easter eggs not include the regular easter eggs that actually found during the gameplay. There is a total of 10 cameras in the pizzeria each named after their location.</p>

<p>The only way that i know this is because on the fifth night you can see glow white eyes in the kitchen. All look the same but vary in stats and attacks which are taken into account to classify them in a difficulty scale from 1 to 5 the game uses stars to indicate this with 1. The camera here is disabled but the player can still hear audio. The bots all looking at the camera cam 1a. Probably to add effect.</p>

<p>In terms of location it is connected to the dining area. Adds another sense of horror depth to the game itself. Easter egg with golden freddy. The camera in the kitchen isn t disabled whoever the lights are off or broken. If chica is in the kitchen the player will hear her rustling around presumably knocking over pots and pans.</p>
